## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use YOLOv8 for vehicle detection, tracking, and counting using OpenCV and Python. The primary objective is to identify vehicles in a video, track their movement, and count the number of vehicles moving in different directions.

## Installation
First, ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
!pip install ultralytics
!pip install pandas
!pip install opencv-python-headless
